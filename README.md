# ScreenSense

This project provides comprehensive insights into a child's screen time and activity patterns. It leverages Generative AI and Machine Learning to help parents manage screen time effectively, predict suitable limits, and encourage balanced social activities for the child. The project includes personalized activity suggestions based on the child’s interests and offers reward recommendations to foster positive behavior.

## Features

1. **Screen Time Insights**: Generates detailed reports on the child's screen usage patterns, providing parents with valuable insights.
2. **Screen Time Prediction**: Uses a machine learning model to predict optimal screen time based on the child’s age, previous usage, and other variables.
3. **Social Activity Suggestions**: Recommends social activities tailored to the child's interests, likes, dislikes, and hobbies to promote balanced engagement.
4. **Reward Suggestions**: Suggests meaningful rewards for parents to encourage and reinforce positive behavior upon task completion.

## Architecture

The project architecture includes the following components:
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Processes screen time data to extract relevant insights.
- **Screen Time Prediction Model**: A RandomForestRegressor model is used to predict the right screen time for the child.
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Utilizes LangChain for task orchestration, with Google Gemini as the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate content and recommendations.
- **Recommendation System**: Provides suggestions for social activities and rewards based on the child’s profile.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary language for backend development.
- **LangChain**: Framework for Generative AI task orchestration.
- **Google Gemini**: Large Language Model (LLM) used for text generation tasks.
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning, with RandomForestRegressor for screen time prediction.
- **Jupyter Notebook (Optional)**: For experimentation and model tuning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/child-screen-time-insights.git
   cd child-screen-time-insights
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up API keys and environment variables for Google Gemini and LangChain in a `.env` file.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Collect screen time data for the child and store it in the specified data format.
2. **Screen Time Prediction**: Run the RandomForestRegressor model to predict the suitable screen time based on input features.
3. **Activity and Reward Recommendations**: Leverage LangChain to generate tailored social activity and reward suggestions.
4. **Insights Generation**: Generate and view reports based on the model’s predictions and the GenAI outputs.
